h1. FancyBox

FancyBox is a rails plugin wrapper for a jquery plugin withe same name. It's essentialy installs and gives you helper methods for using in your views. You can find the original documentation at : http://fancy.klade.lv/. Once you install you can also call it from jquery as well.

h1. Installation

# run rake fancy_box:install:all
# somewhere in the head of your page, put <%= include_fancy_box %>
# That's it!

h1. Usage

To use it for inline content or remote content do:

    link_to_box "Some div", "#some-div"
    or
    link_to_box "google", "http://google.com"
    or
    link_to_box "some page", "/some/page"

To use it for images do:

    link_to_image "special.jpg"
    or to add in a caption
    link_to_image "special.jpg", :title => "special image"

To create an image gallery with fancy boxes do:

    fancy_gallery "one.jpg", "two.jpg"
    or to add captions
    fancy_gallery "one.jpg:first picture", "two.jpg:second picture"

NOTE : if you use a base reset css stylesheet, it will not render the caption properly, hopefully I have some time to fix this, but for now I can do without it, feel free to fix this issue by forking this
